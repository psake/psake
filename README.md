psake is a build automation tool written in PowerShell. It avoids the angle-bracket tax associated with executable XML by leveraging the PowerShell syntax in your build scripts.
psake has a syntax inspired by rake (aka make in Ruby) and bake (aka make in Boo), but is easier to script because it leverages your existing command-line knowledge.

psake is pronounced sake â€“ as in Japanese rice wine. It does NOT rhyme with make, bake, or rake.

## How to get started

**Step 1:** Download and extract the project

You will need to "unblock" the zip file before extracting - PowerShell by default does not run files downloaded from the Internet.
Just right-click the zip and click on "properties" and click on the "unblock" button.

**Step 2:** CD into the directory where you extracted the project (where the psake.psm1 file is)

> Import-Module .\psake.psm1

If you encounter the following error "Import-Module : ...psake.psm1 cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system." Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.

1. Run PowerShell as administrator
2. Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

> Get-Help Invoke-psake -Full
>
> - this will show you help and examples of how to use psake

**Step 3:** Run some examples

> CD .\examples
>
> Invoke-psake
>
> - This will execute the "default" task in the "psakefile.ps1"
>
> Invoke-psake .\psakefile.ps1 Clean
>
> - will execute the single task in the psakefile.ps1 script

**Step 4:** Set your PATH variable

If you wish to use the psake command from outside of the install folder, add the folder install directory to your PATH variable.

**Step 5: (With VS2017)** Install the VSSetup dependency

psake uses [VSSetup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/heaths/2017/01/25/visual-studio-setup-powershell-module-available/) to locate msbuild when using Visual Studio 2017.  The VSSetup PowerShell module must be installed prior to compiling a VS2017 project with psake.  Install instructions for VSSetup can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vssetup.powershell#installing) and [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VSSetup).
