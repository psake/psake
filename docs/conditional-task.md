You can conditionally run a task by using the "precondition" parameter of the "task" function.  The "precondition" parameter expects a scriptblock as its value and that scriptblock should return a $true or $false.

The following is an example build script that uses the "precondition" parameter of the task function:
</p>
<pre>
task default -depends A,B,C

task A {
  "TaskA"
}

task B -precondition { return $false } {
  "TaskB"
}

task C -precondition { return $true } {
  "TaskC"
}
</pre>
<p>
The output from running the above build script looks like the following:
</p>
<pre>
Executing task: A
TaskA
Precondition was false not executing B
Executing task: C
TaskC

Build Succeeded!
